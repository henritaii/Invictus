There are more features to come so prepare for a ride to hell (idk why I said this)
(*) This is not implemented in the downloadable Version here. DM @realhappybacon on Discord for more Information.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Gorilla Tag on PC (obviously)
- BepInEx
- Utilia
- WalkSim

Download BepInEx and Utilia with [MonkeModManager](https://github.com/DeadlyKitten/MonkeModManager), it is the most safe option.
WalkSim is kinda hard to get but trust me, it's worth it.

### Steps

1. **Download & Install BepInEx (and Utilia) via. MonkeModManager**
   I am not going into that one, if you don't know what to do, watch a youtube video.   

2. **Install WalkSim & Invictus**
   Just put the .dll Files into \BepInEx\plugins
   If you haven't installed Utilia till this Moment, you can do that the same way.
3. **Have Fun :D**


## Quick Start
Press [Q] to open and [R] to close the Invictus Menu, from there you can access all functions.

Some Mods do need to be activated by pressing a key on your keyboard, look into the Menu for more Information.

## F&Q

### Can this Mod be used on Quest?
   Well what do you think when you are mostly pressing Keys on a Keyboard? No.
### Do I really NEED WalkSim?
   Actually no, this mod is just made so you can use it in WalkSim, but if you play on PC with a Keyboard, it should work without WalkSim.
### Can I use it with a VR on?
   Sadly no, like said above it is made for Players playing on their PCs (on a Keyboard and Mouse), but I'll be trying to make it working for Gigachad VR Players.
